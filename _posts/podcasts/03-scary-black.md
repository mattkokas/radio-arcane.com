   Third episode from Radio Arcane with hosts Brian Drabant, Motuvius Rex, Gothic Bastard and Sorrow Vomit : Featuring interview with Albie Mason of Scary Black about his new album 'Shadow Dwellers (B​-​Sides)', his creative process and a couple of NEVER TO BE RELEASED EXCLUSIVE TRACKS! Plus one demo clip glimpse of the future!

   Brian Cole of Funeral Party Records also shows up for more because he hates himself but LOVES to PARTY!
   : Specialty segment 'Deep Cuts' with Sorrow Vomit : And quite a bit of awkward banter between the hosts to keep them from weeping and moaning their mortal gloom. Recorded and produced at the non-profit Art Sanctuary in Louisville, KY, Radio Arcane is a collective of Dark Music Specialists that host events, live music and dark arts entertainment.
