  Solstitium Gothici -  

  A Gothic Summer, pre-Solstice, heathen celebration of dark dancing and ritual
  gloom to comfort yourself in the shadows of summer. Feel free to wear your
  sunglasses at night and have a cocktail. If you don't want the booze in your
  cocktail, maybe you would enjoy a non-alcoholic selection from our upcoming
  Faux Bar Menu and be awesome and drive your tipsy friends home safely.



  Dark Music Specialists for June :  

  Sorrow Vomit  

  Thulsa Goon  

  Brian Drabant



  18+ to enter  

  21+ bar  

  $5 cover



  If you are super broke, please just say. Don't let the cover keep you away. We
  have to pay bills, so, we ask you to pay. But even when busted, you might
  still want to play. And we want you to come, we want you to stay. Until we
  must close, then shoo you away. Bad rhymes kind of suck, don't they? Like a
  lot, really. Super shittay.
