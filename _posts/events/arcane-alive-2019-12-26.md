  Radio Arcane presents - Twin Tribes (Texas) live at Highlands Tap Room with Louisville's own Scary Black; the day after Christmas on December 26th. Take a break from holiday stress and unwind to some dark, melodic sounds. You won't regret your decision to get out and dance to some great music. Radio Arcane Dark Music Specialists Kaleidoscope and Sorrow Vomit will be djing between sets so the music doesn't stop.
