  Radio Arcane presents - Twin Tribes (Texas) live at Highlands Tap Room with
  Skeleton Hands (Cincinnati), and Louisville's own Scary Black; the day after Christmas on December 26th. Take a break from holiday stress and unwind to some dark, melodic sounds. You won't regret your decision to get out and dance to some great music. Radio Arcane
  Dark Music Specialists Kaleidoscope and Sorrow-Vomit will be djing between sets so the music doesn't stop.

  **Skeleton Hands** : Skeleton Hands bring an eclectic electronic sound reminiscent of the glory days of post-punk that is simultaneously foreboding and uplifting. With influences ranging from House and Techno to Post-Punk and Goth, Skeleton Hands creates a moody sound with a joyful darkness that rumbles the floor and circles the atmosphere.\

  **SCARY BLACK** : "This is a project inspired by 80s alternative music, radio
  nostalgia, and music from the spaghetti westerns I watched with my aunt every
  Saturday morning."\
